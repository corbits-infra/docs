title: "Model Context Protocol (MCP)"
---

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.

Think of MCP like an trailhead for AI applications. Just like a trailhead provides a uniform way to learn about the trails and facilities, MCP provides a uniform way to connect AI models to different tools and data sources.
