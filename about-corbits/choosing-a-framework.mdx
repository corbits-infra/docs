title: "Choosing the right framework"
description: "Selecting the optimal x402 framework to land your transactions for your application involves balancing three key considerations: capabilities, speed, and cost. This guide helps you make an informed decision based on your specific requirements."
---

## Establish key criteria

When choosing an x402 framework, we recommend first evaluating these factors:

- **Capabilities:** What specific features or capabilities will you need your chosen framework to have in order to meet your needs?
- **Speed:** How quickly does the framework need to respond in your application?
- **Cost:** What's your budget for both development and production usage?

Knowing these answers in advance will make narrowing down and deciding which model to use much easier.

## Choose the best model to start with

There are two general approaches you can use to start testing which x402 framework works best for your needs.

### Option 1: Start with an structured framework

For some applications, starting with an all-in-one model like Coinbase x402 can be the optimal approach:

1. Begin implementation with Coinbase x402
2. Learn how HTTP 402 and stablecoin payments work
3. Quickly test your idea
4. Upgrade only if necessary for specific capability gaps

This approach allows for quick iteration, lower development costs, and is often sufficient for many common applications. This approach is best for:

- Initial prototyping and development
- Applications with explicit Base requirements
- Implementations lacking specific plugins or schemas
- Low-volume, straightforward tasks

### Option 2: Start with the most capable framework

For complex tasks where scalability and advanced capabilities are paramount, you may want to start with the most capable framework and then consider optimizing with more efficient plugins down the line:

1. Implement with Faremeter and Corbits
2. Optimize your deployments for your protocols and payment methods
3. Evaluate if performance meets your requirements
4. Consider increasing efficiency by creating custom plugins over time with greater workflow optimization

This approach is best for:

- Complex payment requirements
- Specific plugin or resourcing needs
- Tasks requiring nuanced understanding
- Applications where accuracy outweighs cost considerations
- Advanced coding

## Decide whether to upgrade or change frameworks

To determine if you need to upgrade or change frameworks, you should:

1. Create benchmark tests specific to your use case - having a good evaluation set is the most important step in the process
2. Test with your actual APIs and data
3. Compare performance across frameworks for:
   - Accuracy of responses
   - Response quality
   - Handling of payments
4. Weigh performance and cost tradeoffs
