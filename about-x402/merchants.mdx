title: "Merchants"
description: "A merchant (sometimes called a seller) is any party that offers digital goods, content, or APIs and monetizes access. Merchants can range from solo developers selling a single endpoint, to enterprises running complex API platforms."

## **Core responsibilities of a merchant**

- **Advertise payment requirements:** Clearly specify which resources or routes require payment and what the pricing is.
- **Verify payments:** When a buyer requests a protected resource, the merchant checks for valid payment proof.
- **Fulfill requests:** If payment is proven, the merchant serves the requested content or API response.
- **Settle payments:** The merchant’s server interacts with a facilitator (either self-hosted or third-party) to verify and settle the on-chain payment, so the merchant doesn’t have to handle underlying payment logic.

## **Key benefits for merchants**

- **No need for account management tools**
- **Universal compatibility:** Any agent, any payment method.
- **Sub-second settlement:** Receive finalized payments in under 1 second
- **Composable, drop-in integration:** Keep your existing server stack and workflows. Just add x402 to existing routes/endpoints with minimal code.
- **Discovery:** Your endpoints are automatically discoverable by programmatic buyers (AIs, agents, platforms), opening up additional revenue streams.

## How merchants fit the payment flow

1. The merchant advertises paid resources, detailing payment requirements and supported chains.
2. When an agent requests access, the merchant middleware detects if payment is required and returns a structured `402 Payment Required` response.
3. Upon receiving a payment proof, the merchant calls the facilitator to verify and settle the payment according to protocol standards.
4. Once payment is confirmed, the merchant fulfills the resource request—delivering the API response, content, or data directly to the agent.
5. All payment logic, verification, and blockchain settlement is orchestrated by the facilitator, enabling rapid and secure monetization for the merchant.
