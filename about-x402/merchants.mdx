title: "Merchants"
description: "A merchant (sometimes called a seller) in the x402 protocol is any party that offers digital goods, content, or APIs and monetizes access via on-chain payments. Merchants can range from solo developers selling a single endpoint, to enterprises running complex API platforms."

## **Core responsibilities of a merchant**

- **Advertise payment requirements:** Clearly specify which resources or routes require payment and what the pricing is.
- **Verify payments:** When a buyer requests a protected resource, the merchant checks for valid payment proof, using standard x402 headers.
- **Fulfill requests:** If payment is proven, the merchant serves the requested content or API response.
- **Settle payments:** The merchant’s server interacts with a facilitator (either self-hosted or third-party) to verify and settle the on-chain payment, so the merchant doesn’t have to handle underlying payment logic.

## **Key benefits for merchants**

- **No need to manage accounts**
- **Universal compatibility:** Any agent, any payment method
- **Instant settlement:** Receive funds in under one second

## **In short**

A merchant or seller in x402 is anyone who monetizes digital products via HTTP, accepting instant on-chain payments and gaining access to frictionless, programmable commerce infrastructure.
