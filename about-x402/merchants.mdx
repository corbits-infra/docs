title: "Merchants"
description: "A merchant (sometimes called a seller) is any party that offers digital goods, content, or APIs and monetizes access. Merchants can range from solo developers selling a single endpoint, to enterprises running complex API platforms."

## **Core responsibilities of a merchant**

- **Advertise payment requirements:** Clearly specify which resources or routes require payment and what the pricing is.
- **Verify payments:** When a buyer requests a protected resource, the merchant checks for valid payment proof.
- **Fulfill requests:** If payment is proven, the merchant serves the requested content or API response.
- **Settle payments:** The merchant’s server interacts with a facilitator (either self-hosted or third-party) to verify and settle the on-chain payment, so the merchant doesn’t have to handle underlying payment logic.

## **Key benefits for merchants**

- **No need for account management tools**
- **Universal compatibility:** Any agent, any payment method.
- **Sub-second settlement:** Receive finalized payments in under 1 second
- **Composable, drop-in integration:** Keep your existing server stack and workflows. Just add x402 to existing routes/endpoints with minimal code.
- **Discovery:** Your endpoints are automatically discoverable by programmatic buyers (AIs, agents, platforms), opening up additional revenue streams.
