title: "x402 Overview"
description: "x402 represents a new innovative open payment protocol, enabling instant transactions over HTTP. The protocol allows both humans and machine agents to programmatically pay for access without the need for user accounts, sessions, or complex authentication procedures."
---

## Who is x402 for?

- **Sellers:** Service providers who want to monetize their APIs or content. x402 enables direct, programmatic payments from clients with minimal setup.
- **Buyers:** Human developers and AI agents seeking to access paid services without accounts or manual payment flows.

Both sellers and buyers interact directly through HTTP requests, with payment handled transparently through the protocol.

## Use cases

x402 enables a range of use cases, including:

- API services paid per request
- AI agents that autonomously pay for API access
- Paywalls for digital content
- Microservices and tooling monetized via microtransactions
- Proxy services that aggregate and resell API capabilities

## How it works

x402 uses a simple request-response flow with programmatic payments. For a detailed explanation, see [How x402 Works](/x402/core-concepts/how-it-works).

At a high level:

1. The buyer requests a resource from the server (e.g. an API call, see [client/server roles](/x402/core-concepts/client-server))
2. If payment is required, the server responds with a [402 Payment Required](/x402/core-concepts/http-402), including payment instructions
3. The buyer constructs and sends a payment payload
4. The server verifies and settles the payment via the [facilitator](/x402/core-concepts/facilitator). If valid, the server returns the requested resource

## Beyond legacy limitations

x402 is designed for a modern internet economy, solving key limitations of legacy systems:

- **Reduce fees and friction:** Direct onchain payments without intermediaries, high fees, or manual setup.
- **Micropayments & usage-based billing:** Charge per call or feature with simple, programmable pay-as-you-go flows.
- **Machine-to-machine transactions:** Let AI agents pay and access services autonomously with no keys or human input needed.

## Offload your infra

The x402 [Facilitator](/x402/core-concepts/facilitator) handles payment verification and settlement so that sellers don't need to maintain their own blockchain infrastructure.

The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) offers a Coinbase-hosted facilitator service that processes fee-free USDC payments on the Base network, offering a streamlined and predictable experience for both buyers and sellers.

Facilitators handle verification and settlement, so sellers do not need to maintain blockchain infrastructure.

CDP's x402 facilitator provides:

- Fee-free USDC payments on the Base network
- Fast, onchain settlement of transactions
- Simplified setup for sellers to start accepting payments
