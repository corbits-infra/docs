      <Step title="Set your private key">
        Generate your private key from the [Solana Cookbook](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook/wallets/create-keypair) (or use your own) and set it as an environmental variable:

        ```
        export ADMIN_KEYPAIR_PATH='your-solana-private-key-here'
        ```
      </Step>
      <Step title="Make your first x402 call">
        Run this command to run a simple data query:

        ```
        curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/weather-demo-webhook/weather-demo \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{"zipcode": "10001", "callbackUrl": "https://n8n-corbits.ngrok.app/weather-callback"}'
        
        {
          "success": true,
          "callbackUrl": "https://n8n-corbits.ngrok.app/weather-callback",
          "method": "POST",
          "attempts": 1,
          "response": {
            "status": 200,
            "headers": {
              "content-length": "85",
              "content-type": "application/json",
              "date": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 15:32:53 GMT"
            },
            "data": {
              "success": true,
              "message": "Callback received",
              "timestamp": "2025-09-17T15:32:53.458Z"
            }
          }
        }
        ```

        Example output:

        ```
        {
            "timestamp": "2025-09-17T15:32:16.106Z",
            "success": true,
